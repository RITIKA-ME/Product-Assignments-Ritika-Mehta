# 🔥 **My Product Thinking Philosophy**

I believe in products that are:

* **Simple** → Users shouldn’t think twice.
* **Human** → Built on real motivations & emotions.
* **Insight-led** → Rooted in real behavior, not assumptions.
* **Impact-first** → Every feature must improve metrics or experience.
* **Iterative** → Ship fast, learn fast.

Great products remove friction, create habits, and deliver delight.
